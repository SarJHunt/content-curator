# chrismeah.com

This is a personal responsive web app for Chris Meah using React which provides users with information about what he does, and showcases his experience in building, training, and speaking about AI.

The site is deployed [here](https://chris-meah.vercel.app) and my approach is outlined below.

## üå† Requirements

### üéØ Overall aims

To help:

- users interested in learning more about AI and Chris's background
- companies and leaders find information about consulting or tailored AI training
- event organisers seeking an engaging speaker on AI

### UI preferences

- Engaging visuals, interactions and imagery
- Future-oriented aesthetic

### Essential content

- Testimonials
- clear descriptions of the service offerings
- Embedded videos
- Calendar feature to book meetings
- Clear ways to contact Chris including LinkedIn

## üìñ Planning and ideation

As part of the planning process, I set up a [Figjam board](https://www.figma.com/board/L4GzQkvDIeerzPiZi7Ov3c/Chris-Meah-website?node-id=1-76&t=XMjio1VXhnIDBWW0-1) to capture ideas.

Steps included:

- Review of websites with futuristic designs
- Part of the 'dreamer' ideas included a Chris bot, audio upon landing on the site, automation of processes on the site (whatever that might look like).
- Deciding on a Next.js and Tailwind.css for tech stack because of familiarity and use of API routing if needed for AI integrations/fetching information from a database.
- Using V0 to create a striking animation due to lack of available imagery that captured my neural networks idea.
- Choosing colours: my instinct was blues, purples and reds.
- Deciding to aim for a clean web app that provided the relevant information but didn't overwhelm the user.
- Identifying MVPs although honestly, that got a little fuzzy due to it being a competition! Tried to do more than was perhaps necessary.
- Adding in the Substack link and the calendar functionality.
- Deployment to Vercel to check early that the set-up of the proposed app works.
- Checking that the app can be relatively easy to link to Strapi (it can be). 
- The decision to obtain some user feedback in advance of submission.
- The decision to outline my approach to the web app in a clear way (i.e. this document).


## üîç Considerations

- Interpreting Chris's brand for the UI

- Judging the level of animation and interaction vs credence

- Accessibility - [initial audit feedback here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-chris-meah-vercel-app/rszbl7ayrk?form_factor=desktop)

- How much to build vs stating the future plans 

## üí°Additional features implemented

- Light/dark mode toggle: for user preference and accessibility

- Responsive design - so the site adjusts based on device

- Contact form - user-friendly way of getting in touch. I set up Formspree to handle submissions. A fuller review of what method would be required going forward.

- AI assistant - which seemed appropriate considering the services offered but needs further consideration. 
  
- Smart content section: this is where the 'Insights' section appears. It has been hard-coded but the idea is that it could track what sections the user looks at and update content (when more is there) to reflect that interest.

- AI tools section: as it has been removed from the nav, see the page by clicking [here](https://chris-meah.vercel.app/tools). The rationale was that it might be apt to have an example of what AI can do. But this may be better showcased through a project.

- Meeting booking: I used Calendly after some research of what worked well for handling diary management including the Apple ecosystem. Going forwards, this can be reviewed as to which tool is best.

## ‚û°Ô∏è UX and feedback

I asked several people for feedback and some more formal research can be undertaken in future. However, initial comments were useful, which stated that:

- the app hit the requirements of the brief
- the app met the futuristic design expectations
- the calendar tool worked well
- the AI assistant was a nice touch
- the user preference was for light mode
- the icon with 'Dr Chris Meah' in the header was a nice design touch
- the navigation should include testimonials for quick links
- the AI tools menu appears and reappears so confusing for users
- a 'back-to-top' button might be useful

In response to this feedback, here are the changes implemented:

- the legibility of text in dark mode improved but needs some further work
- testimonials now appear in the nav bar
- the removal of AI tools link from the nav bar 
- a 'back-to-top' arrow was added in as users scroll down the page.


## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

If development of the app moves forward, then it will incorporate wider user feedback.

Other aims include:

- Adding case studies of projects you've worked on

- Feed for external AI-related news

- a link to FAQs about some common queries/misunderstandings about what AI incorporates
  
- Reviewing accessibility suggestions

- Testing

- CI/CD and DevOps

- Incorporation of AI tools

- Linking up to a CMS

## ‚úÖ Summary and some final comments

- All content will, of course, need to be reviewed but the app showcases most of the requirements of the brief along with some further ideas for development. 

- The consultancy 'card' in the services section links to Calendly as an example of where the booking functionality could reside. It could appear in each service description or move to be part of the contact section (which would be cleaner, on reflection).

- The 'School of Code' section could be more prominent; for example, already in view for the user rather than clicking on the link to see it. 

- The 'About' section could be longer. I was unsure of how much you wanted to convey in this area vs letting the services and School of Code information speak to other credentials. 

- The 'Testimonials' section could stand out further - perhaps it is more of a wall of images that you click on and each flips to show the quote.

- I really enjoyed working on this project - it definitely provided motivation and it was satisfying to develop ideas around the brief.
