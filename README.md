# chrismeah.com

This is a personal website for Chris Meah using React which provides information about what he does, and showcases his experience in building, training, and speaking about AI.

## Requirements

### Overall aims

To help:

- users interested in learning more about AI and Chris's background
- companies and leaders find information about consulting or tailored AI training
- event organisers seeking an engaging speaker on AI

### UI preferences

- Engaging visuals, interactions and imagery
- Future-oriented aesthetic

### Essential content

- Testimonials
- clear descriptions of the service offerings
- Embedded videos
- Calendar feature to book meetings
- Clear ways to contact Chris including LinkedIn

## Planning and ideation

As part of the planning process, I set up a Figjam board to capture ideas.

Steps included:

- Review of websites with futuristic designs
- Using V0 to create a striking animation due to lack of available imagery that captured my neural networks idea.
- Choosing colours: my instinct was blues, purples and reds.
- Deciding to aim for a clean web app that provided the relevant information but didn't overwhelm the user.
- Identifying MVPs although honestly, that got a little fuzzy due to it being a competition! Tried to do more than was perhaps necessary.
- Part of the 'dreamer' ideas included a Chris bot, audio upon landing on the site, automation of processes on the site (whatever that might look like).

## Considerations

- Interpreting Chris's brand for the UI

- Judging the level of animation and interaction vs credence

- Accessibility - [initial audit feedback here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-chris-meah-vercel-app/rszbl7ayrk?form_factor=desktop)

## UX and feedback

I asked several people for feedback and some more formal UX can be undertaken in future. However, initial comments were useful:

- hits the requirements of the brief
- meets futuristic design expectations
- calendar tool looks good
- AI assistant is a nice touch
- user preference for light mode UI
- the icon with 'Dr Chris Meah' in the header looks good
- navigation should include testimonials for quick links
- AI tools menu appears and reappears so confusing
- a 'back to top' button might be useful

In response to this feedback, here are the changes implemented:

- dark mode improved but needs work. However, the preference for light could depend on user.
- included testimonials in nav bar
- removed AI tools link but you can see the page here:

## Roadmap

If development of the app moves forward, then it will incorporate wider user feedback.

Other aims might include:

- Review accessibility suggestions

- Testing

- CI/CD and DevOps

- Incorporation of AI tools

- Linking to a CMS

## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

- Fixed original lag in animations
- Updated visibility of dynamic background in hero section
- Accessibility requirements
